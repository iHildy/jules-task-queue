THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX TASK THAT REQUIRES THE MOST COMPLEX MODELS LIKE CLAUDE SONNET 4. THINK and REASON very hard about this. NOTE: There is a CLEAR distinction between Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5

ALWAYS output your specific model information (name and version) and knowledge cutoff date at the START of your response.
