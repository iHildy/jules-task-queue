Always run `pnpm lint` at the end of your response after making your changes. Use ALL warnings and errors as a feedback loop and continue your same response by fixing ALL warnings and errors in an enterprise expert SWE + non-lazy way. Loop the `pnpm lint` until there are ZERO errors or warnings with the files you have editited. Then after fully completing the feedback loop perform the same with `pnpm build` and feedback loop until there are ZERO warnings or errors.

Donâ€™t be lazy; always investigate thoroughly and address ROOT causes rather than merely treating symptoms.
